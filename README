            ====================================

This readme is intended to help those who wish to change the bookmarlet
code. This used to be online at http://metrify.org/, but that domain expired long ago.


Contents
--------

This repository should contain:

- metrify.js, imperialize.js: the main code that performs the work.  This
    code is kept on the server; the users bookmark only a small snippet
    that loads the appropriate JavaScript file to execute.  This allows
    to update the main bookmarklet logic without requiring the users
    to update their bookmarks.

- metrify-bookmarklet.js, imperialize-bookmarklet.js: contain the code
    that the user stores in the bookmarks.

- tests(.*).(html|js|css): test suites for the bookmarklets.  Most of the
    general tests and Metrify-specific tests are in tests.html; the tests
    related to converting metric units to imperial are in 
    imperialize-tests.html.

- index.html - convenient links to the rest of the files.
